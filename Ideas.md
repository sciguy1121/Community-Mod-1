## Ideas to be implemented

Tunnel Bore (EXPENSIVE) - Powered using the new coals, used to tunnel and mine

Copper Armor/Tools - Very weak, weaker than iron, can mine same level as stone

Platinum Armor/Tools - Strong, almost as strong as diamond, mines same level as iron

Titanium Armor/Tools - Stronger than iron, weaker than diamond, same mining as iron

Concrete Alloy Furnace - Used to smelt advanced ores/alloys (like Cosileadium Alloy(Made from Copper, Silicon, Lead, and Titanium))

Tech. Discovery System - Some kind of system so that the player must discover technologies

Silicon Chips - Using silicon to make computer parts and computers that you can code in

Robots - Mobs like iron golems or goloms, or wither that you build with different parts

Lava Furnace - Allows players to smelt/cook with no fuel source. Lava block must be placed under LavaFurnace block (Idea being worked on by smigolpol)


## Ideas to be discussed

Block/Item Transport - Would Technicraft use a pipe based system or a mob/entity system like TC3.

Tech Levels:
        Tier 1 - Uses things like stone/iron/titanium/lead to craft machines.
        
        Tier 2 - Uses other metals francium/urdium/tungsten.
        
        Tier 3 - Uses items from other dimension(NYI) to craft stages of key components.

API's - Are there any API's that would be good to use? eg. Forestry
