## Ideas to be implemented

Tunnel Bore (EXPENSIVE) - Powered using the new coals, used to tunnel and mine

Copper Armor/Tools - Very weak, weaker than iron, can mine same level as stone

Platinum Armor/Tools - Strong, almost as strong as diamond, mines same level as iron

Titanium Armor/Tools - Stronger than iron, weaker than diamond, same mining as iron

Concrete Alloy Furnace - Used to smelt advanced ores/alloys (like Cosileadium Alloy(Made from Copper, Silicon, Lead, and Titanium))

Tech. Discovery System - Some kind of system so that the player must discover technologies

Silicon Chips - Using silicon to make computer parts and computers that you can code in

Robots - Mobs like iron golems or goloms, or wither that you build with different parts

Lava Furnace - Allows players to smelt/cook with no fuel source. Lava block must be placed under LavaFurnace block (Idea implemented by smigolpol)

Concrete Liquid - Flows like lava, eventually freezes into concrete

Jackhammer - The quickest, yet most expensive way to break hardened concrete

Block/Item Transport - Would Technicraft use a pipe based system or a mob/entity system like TC3.--Why not a new Idea?

Tech Levels:
        
                Tier 1 - Uses things like stone/iron/titanium/lead to craft machines.
        
                Tier 2 - Uses other metals francium/urdium/tungsten.
                
                Tier 3 - Uses items from other dimension(NYI) to craft stages of key components.

API's - Are there any API's that would be good to use? eg. Forestry

Elemental Tools and Elemental Drills - made with the different new mod ingots

Power/Energy System - like megajewls, EU, etc.
    See energysys.txt by Pieman103021 for an extended idea

Dimensional Ores - Make some ores only avalible in some dimensions

Custom Dungeuns - like pyramids and temples (only avalible in other dimensions)

Transport/Teleport System - For items and people

Particle Breaker/Particle Accelerator/Cyclotron - Used from breaking down francium to lead and other metals to other metals

Solar Panel System - to get energy fromthings other thasn coal

Portal to tech dimension made of Titanium, Lead, Francium, and Silicon Blocks (2 of each) and 2 Diamond Blocks

Logger - gives 6 planks instead of 4

Discovery Book - Store your discoveries in it

Energy Sticks and Powder - Used as fuel

iPod - made from silicon chips and plays your music disks (made from silicon chips)

Computer Minecarts - make the computer then make programs to make the minecart move

DNA Usage and Cloning - DNA Extracter that takes dna from animal meat and lets you clone animals and change their characteristics

GCEUs - Greater Community Energy Units

Goloms or Gnomes - Do stuff for you (like in TC3) just you can make them do whatever (maybe program with silicon chips)?

Robot/RobotAI - Craftable Robot that you place like a spawn egg to spawn a robot. The robot will then kill things for you :)

##Realized Ideas

Lava Furnace(alias: Geothermal Oven) - implemented by smigolpol
