## Ideas to be implemented

Tunnel Bore (EXPENSIVE) - Powered using the new coals, used to tunnel and mine

Copper Armor/Tools - Very weak, weaker than iron, can mine same level as stone

Platinum Armor/Tools - Strong, almost as strong as diamond, mines same level as iron

Titanium Armor/Tools - Stronger than iron, weaker than diamond, same mining as iron

Concrete Alloy Furnace - Used to smelt advanced ores/alloys (like Cosileadium Alloy(Made from Copper, Silicon, Lead, and Titanium))

Tech. Discovery System - Some kind of system so that the player must discover technologies

Silicon Chips - Using silicon to make computer parts and computers that you can code in

Robots - Mobs like iron golems or goloms, or wither that you build with different parts

Basic Machines - Low tier machines that don't change the gameplay too much.

Lava Furnace - Allows players to smelt/cook with no fuel source. Lava block must be placed under LavaFurnace block (Idea being worked on by smigolpol)

Concrete Liquid - Flows like lava, eventually freezes into concrete

Jackhammer - The quickest way to destroy concrete
