    Energy Creation:
        Tier 1:
            ATP to PE Machine(needs name)
            You can put in any type of living materials and it will "extract" ATP and convert it into PE or Physical Energy. 
            Takes 5 Ticks to do each conversion.
            
            Seeds-7
            Pumpkin Seeds-15
            Pumpkin-20
            Melon Seeds-13
            Melon-35
            Apple-8
            Leaves-3
            Grass-3
            Vines-3
            Lilly Pads-5
            Logs-5

        Tier 2:
            Photosynthesiser
            A solar panel that replicates photosynthesis.
            5 PE/tick
    
        Tier 3:
            Energy Super Collector
            Collects ATP from surrounding living entities and blocks like Cows, Sheep, Pigs, Plants, Trees, etc... Not Hostile Mobs, or the player
            1 PE/Tick/#LivingEntites/Blocks

        Tier 4:
            Nuclear Reactor
            Uses Refined uranium to create power, Dangerous macinery if not covered with water when working it will explode.
            50 PE/Tick/Refined uranium
    
    Energy Storage:
        Make PE Levels For Each of The Tiers
        Tier 1:
            Energy Pool
           
        Tier 2:
            Energy Reservoir
            
        Tier 3: 
            Synchronized Energy Storage Unit
